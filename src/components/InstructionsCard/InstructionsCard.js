    <p class="card-text">This game is similar to how the board game Memory works. Start by selecting a card from the cards below and make sure to remember which one you chose. The cards will then shuffle. The goal of the game is to only choose cards that you haven't previously chosen. Your score is shown at the top right along with your Top Score. Good luck!</p>
